Instead, it is wrenched into the daylight and made the main focus. The \"program\" then becomes primarily a document directed at humans, with the code being herded between \"code delimiters\" from where it can be extracted and shuffled out sideways to the language system by literate programming tools.\n","[Ross Williams][1]\n","\n","[1]: http://www.literateprogramming.com/lpquotes.html"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NT4CsLCxInDQ"},"source":["Libraries\n","---------\n","\n","We will work with a number of *libraries*, which provide additional functions and techniques to help us to carry out our tasks.\n","\n","These include:\n","\n","*Pandas:* we'll use this a lot to slice and dice data\n","\n","*matplotlib*: this is our basic graphing software, and we'll also use it for mapping\n","\n","*nltk*: The Natural Language Tool Kit will help us work with text\n","\n","We aren't doing all this to learn to program.
